[TP, 1] typecheck error: Var name: REF_26 Func name: settleAccount in EXPRESSION self.balances[account] = newBalance.abs()
```

Explanation for [TP, 1]: In function `settleAccount()`, `newBalance.abs()` is categorized as a debt financial type due to adding the incorrect caluclation for `self.shortfall`. 
Hence, there is a financial type mismatch when `self.balances[account]`, which is a categorized as a raw balance, is set to `newBalance.abs()`
