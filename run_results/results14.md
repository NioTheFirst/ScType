Expected Warnings (3):
```
[TP, 1] typecheck error: Var name: TMP_28 Func name: _transfer in EXPRESSION _balances[sender] = _balances[sender].sub(amount,ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance)

[TPP, 1] typecheck error: Var name: TMP_29 Func name: _transfer in EXPRESSION _balances[recipient] = _balances[recipient].add(amount)

[TPP, 1] typecheck error: Var name: TMP_88 Func name: transferFrom in ENTRY_POINT
```

Explanation of [TP, 1]: The `pricePerShare()` function returns an incorrect price.
Hence, in `_transer`, when `_balances[sender]` is subtracted by `amount`, which was generated by `_balanceOf` which calls `pricePerShare()`, there is a token mismatch.
