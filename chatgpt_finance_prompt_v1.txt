In smart contracts written in Solidity, many variables have a financial meaning. Given the following financial labels of: {balance, price, fee, reserve, debt, and interest}, a number of examples describing a variable of each financial meaning is provided.

The following are examples of variables of the balance financial type. The format of the examples are: a snippet of code containing the variable followed by the name of the variables belonging to the category.
Code: "function _deposit(uint256 _amount) internal override {
        // We receive bCVX -> Convert to bCVX
        CVX_VAULT.withdraw(_amount);

        uint256 toDeposit = IERC20Upgradeable(CVX).balanceOf(address(this));

        // Lock tokens for 17 weeks, send credit to strat, always use max boost cause why not?
        LOCKER.lock(address(this), toDeposit, LOCKER.maximumBoostPayment());
    }", 
Variables: "_amount"
Code: "/// @dev used to manage the governance and strategist fee on earned rewards, make sure to use it to get paid!
    function _processRewardsFees(uint256 _amount, address _token)
        internal
        returns (uint256 governanceRewardsFee, uint256 strategistRewardsFee)
    {
        governanceRewardsFee = _processFee(
            _token,
            _amount,
            performanceFeeGovernance,
            IController(controller).rewards()
        );

        strategistRewardsFee = _processFee(
            _token,
            _amount,
            performanceFeeStrategist,
            strategist
        );
    }"
Variables: "_amount"
