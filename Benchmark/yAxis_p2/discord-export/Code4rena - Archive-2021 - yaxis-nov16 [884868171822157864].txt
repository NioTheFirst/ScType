Hey guys, quick question. Can you share with me your thought process on why strategies are stored in both Harvester.sol and in Controller.sol?


[14-Sep-21 07:25 AM] cmichel#0001
I think you're talking about Harvester and Controller?

💯 

[14-Sep-21 07:26 AM] itsmeSTYJ#4682
Ah yes, controller not manager. Thanks @cmichel !

[14-Sep-21 02:59 PM] MrMister#4685
Thanks for the question! 

Strategies in the harvester are only for rotating harvests. Strategies in the controller are for priority of withdrawals.


[14-Sep-21 04:07 PM] itsmeSTYJ#4682
What does priority of withdrawals mean? That these strategies are related to withdrawals?

Does that mean that there is an assumption that the strategies in the controller are not the same as the ones in the harvester?

Just submitted my findings. I went to the repo to get links to some referenced lines (like http...github...#L14) and I noticed that some lines number differ from the one I had written down. Here I panicked 😅  thinking that maybe I missed one announcement that the code changed or whatever. Nevertheless I just write down what I found.
Now I checked the diffs, and actually the sponsor committed some solutions. So congrats who found earlier I guess..


[15-Sep-21 05:50 PM] ⛅CloudEllie#4509
Thanks for letting us know. We’ll look into this ASAP.


[15-Sep-21 05:56 PM] ⛅CloudEllie#4509
Please do submit your finding regardless. If and when duplicate findings are submitted, we review them all in parallel, without preference to who submitted first.

Is the scope all contracts in `v3/alchemix` or just `YaxisVaultAdapter.sol` and parts from `Alchemist.sol`?


[16-Nov-21 02:38 AM] Waali1#4203
Thanks for reaching out. I can confirm all contracts


[16-Nov-21 02:38 AM] Waali1#4203
