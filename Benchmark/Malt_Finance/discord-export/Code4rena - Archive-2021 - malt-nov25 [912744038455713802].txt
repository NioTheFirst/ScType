In security


[24-Nov-21 04:48 PM] HardlyDifficult#1668
hey, trying to get started by running the tests. `npx hardhat compile` produced most of the type files, but `Oracle` and `LiquidityMine` are missing. This causes `npx hardhat test` to fail -- I'm not seeing those files in the contracts dir. Is there another step to get setup?


[24-Nov-21 04:55 PM] itsmetechjay | C4#5294
Tagging in @0xScotch ^^


[24-Nov-21 04:57 PM] 0xScotch#6626
Those are old contracts, they shouldn't be in the repo. Maybe I erroneously copied them over


[24-Nov-21 04:57 PM] 0xScotch#6626
I'll pull the repo fresh and see if I can reproduce the issue


[24-Nov-21 05:00 PM] 0xScotch#6626
Or are the types being imported in some tests? If thats the case then those lines should just be removed. My mistake if those made it in there


[24-Nov-21 05:01 PM] HardlyDifficult#1668
they are imported in helpers.ts

removing the imports and the functions that breaks then causes Auction.test.ts to error..


[24-Nov-21 05:03 PM] HardlyDifficult#1668
it's a bit of a rabit hole, but yea doesn't look like any of this is required. it would be helpful to all if you could push up changes to remove the old stuff


[24-Nov-21 05:04 PM] 0xScotch#6626
I am more than happy to fix that and push the changes. @itsmetechjay | C4 is that allowed?


[24-Nov-21 05:05 PM] itsmetechjay | C4#5294
Yep!


[24-Nov-21 05:06 PM] HardlyDifficult#1668
just got it running, i could pr it if you want


[24-Nov-21 05:10 PM] HardlyDifficult#1668
Getting a bunch of test failures with no changes other than cleaning up the import problem


[24-Nov-21 05:11 PM] asdfff#2381
>You should already have the UI repo cloned locally in the same directory as this repo (If you do not have access to the UI repo ask for access)


[24-Nov-21 05:11 PM] asdfff#2381
pls ser where is ui repo


[24-Nov-21 05:12 PM] asdfff#2381
or is it out of scope


[24-Nov-21 05:19 PM] 0xScotch#6626
The UI isn't in the scope of the audit but if you feel like it will be helpful for your understanding / workflow then I am more than happy to give you access


[24-Nov-21 05:20 PM] 0xScotch#6626
I'll push the fixes now. Just running the test suite to make sure its working. (all tests should pass except a bunch in `RewardDistributor.test.ts` which broke due to a change made in the `RewardDistributor` contract recently and the tests haven't been updated for the new behaviour


[24-Nov-21 05:21 PM] HardlyDifficult#1668
ah, yea that's most of them that I saw. There was also 2 fails in `AuctionEscapeHatch`

All escape hatch tests are passing on the new PR. Should be good to go when it gets merged

PR has been merged


[24-Nov-21 05:30 PM] HardlyDifficult#1668
It seems to be a timing issue. Sometimes passes, sometimes fails. But I can work with this -- thanks!


[24-Nov-21 05:32 PM] 0xScotch#6626
Curious. Never run into that. Would be interested in hearing more about it if you find something concrete. Obviously low priority vs rest of the tasks at hand though


[28-Nov-21 09:21 AM] Throttle#2085
@0xScotch Which compiler version was used for compilation?


[28-Nov-21 12:12 PM] 0xScotch#6626
0.6.6

[01-Dec-21 05:29 PM] 0xScotch#6626
Thanks to everyone who submitted any findings to the Malt contest. I'm super happy to be able to play a part in this new open security model.


[01-Dec-21 05:32 PM] 0xScotch#6626
Not sure how often project devs say this but it's truly amazing for us (for me at least) to go through this process because we learn so much just seeing what gets found. Both in terms of specific learning for the project being audited but also generally about mistakes we make or things we overlook when we code. Its truly a win win for everyone involved!
