Some questions that have been coming in:
- **What is 6646?**: 6646 is an approximate of how many blocks are mined a day
- **Just wanted to ask if the DelegatedStaking.sol contract has been deployed and if there was a particular script used to do this?**: The contract has been tested on local fork and the deployment function is in helpers file

@🐺wardens I'm little late in posting this, but… the Covalent contest is now closed! Huge thanks to everyone who participated 🔍, whether you submitted a finding or not.

**What's next: **the Covalent team will review the findings over the next couple of days, and then we'll pass them off to the judge. We'll announce awards 🤑🏆 in #🐺wardens, and keep an eye on #📢announcements for regular updates on how the contest is progressing through judging 🧑‍⚖️ and reporting 📜. Feel free to ping an organizer if you have questions along the way!
