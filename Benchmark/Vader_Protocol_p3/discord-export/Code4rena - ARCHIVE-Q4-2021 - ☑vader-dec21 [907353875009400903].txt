are both `dex` and `dex-v2` contracts in scope? The README only talks about `dex-v2`


[10-Nov-21 03:51 AM] SamStein#6247
dex is also in scope

I've noticed that one of my findings for this contest is invalid. Can I DM someone the title and have it removed?


[12-Nov-21 07:27 AM] ⛅CloudEllie#4509
Yep, you're welcome to DM me!

Is anyone from vader team available for questions ? I've messaged @SamStein  a few days ago and haven't received a response. I have some additional questions I was hoping to ask about the project which I had some trouble with.


[14-Nov-21 01:52 PM] ninek | C4#1475
@🔥Mervyn🔥 heads up ^

are all the files in scope?


[21-Dec-21 05:10 AM] SamStein#6247
We are interested this time for LBTwap, USDV, Vader and AMM core


[21-Dec-21 07:22 AM] Shargon#1912
[https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-vader/tree/main/repo/vader-bond/contracts] is excluded from the scope?


[21-Dec-21 10:52 AM] ⛅CloudEllie#4509
Hey @🐺wardens, we can see the scope needs clarification for this contest, so we've reached out to the sponsors to request that they update the readme to reflect that. We're also thinking the contest will need to be extended by a day or two.

Given time zone differences, it may be a bit until these questions are resolved, but we'll post an update here once they are. Thanks for your patience! 🙏

by AMM core you mean dex-v2?


[22-Dec-21 03:52 AM] SamStein#6247
yes but only the changes that happened since the last audit we are preparing a pull request to point out the actual code that needs to be covered


[22-Dec-21 04:06 AM] SamStein#6247
Scope
The audit should be focused on the LBTwap implementation under contracts/lbt, the USDV implementation under contracts/token and the functionality related in the AMM.

LBTwap
USDV
dex-v2/pool
Excluded
The following contract/directories are excluded as they are already audited but included in the repository for reference.

dex
dex-v2/router
dex-v2/synths
dex-v2/wrapper
mocks
staking-rewards/Pausable.sol
external

You can also remove any findings that are related to excluded portions of the code. thank you and happy hunting.


[22-Dec-21 04:10 AM] Czar102#5072
Will the contest duration be extended?


[22-Dec-21 04:43 AM] ⛅CloudEllie#4509
Yes, just waking up here in the US and will confer with my colleagues on the west coast to figure out the exact close time. You can assume you have at least an extra 24 hours beyond the scheduled contest length.


[22-Dec-21 04:46 AM] Czar102#5072

The last 2 commits of `README.md` aren't visible on the code4rena website, the commit shown is https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-vader/commit/00ed84015d4116da2f9db0c68db6742c89e73f65

I think wardens should refer to the github specification, (last commit) as there were some important scope changes and exclusions were specified.

Just to assure, is this the full scope?
```
contracts/lbt/LiquidityBasedTWAP.sol
contracts/tokens/converter/Converter.sol
contracts/tokens/USDV.sol
contracts/tokens/Vader.sol
contracts/tokens/vesting/LinearVesting.sol
contracts/dex-v2/pool/BasePoolV2.sol
contracts/dex-v2/pool/VaderPoolV2.sol
```


[22-Dec-21 10:09 AM] SamStein#6247
Yes


[22-Dec-21 12:25 PM] Tom | Balancer#3331
Heads up to wardens that 

```
contracts/tokens/converter/Converter.sol
contracts/tokens/Vader.sol
contracts/tokens/vesting/LinearVesting.sol
```

seem to all be in production already so while they're in scope there's not really much point in suggesting gas optimisations, etc.

Hi @🐺wardens  -- thanks for all your efforts so far on this contest, and for your patience while we got the scope sorted out.

Given that we're about 2/3 through the scheduled contest time (and it's the holidays), we're going to extend the cutoff time by 48 hours -- so **the new end date/time will be Dec 25 at 23:59 UTC. **

We will also be considering out-of-scope submissions that came in before the scope was clarified to be valid. 

Since the C4 team is heading out on holidays, we will be slower than usual to respond to questions, but members of our team will be checking in as they're able to address any questions. Happy holidays! ☃️

@SamStein Can we take it as a given that the reserves can be manipulated with flashloans similar to Uniswap and other DEXs or do we need to establish that this can be done profitably in any findings?

Vader has stated elsewhere that the slip based fee protects against flashloan attacks but considering that swaps can be split into many smaller trades this doesn't seem to stand up. Do we need to crack out Desmos to prove this or are you happy to accept the heuristic proof "Fees increase with trade size so breaking a large trade into several small ones reduce the amount of fees paid"?


[22-Dec-21 03:39 PM] Adrian 🐢#8028
They state somewhere in their docs that this is true. Quoting from memory but it’s something like, “this system breaks path independence as lower fees will be paid by breaking trades into many smaller ones. However, this is desirable as it slows down the price movement” or something like that


[22-Dec-21 03:47 PM] Tom | Balancer#3331
Thanks, yeah this combined with the fact you can call the `swap` function many times in a single transaction seems sufficient for me to say that flashloans are fair game. The fact they accept that splitting a trade into multiple reduces fees is all we need.


[22-Dec-21 03:48 PM] Tom | Balancer#3331
Not sure I buy the "slows down price movement" claim.


[23-Dec-21 05:31 AM] Adrian 🐢#8028
I agree. That’s partly why I remember it


[23-Dec-21 05:39 AM] Czar102#5072
Agreed.
