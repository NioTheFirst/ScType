Hey everyone, really excited for u guys to start hacking away finding bugs on our new product, Rocket Joe. 

In a nutshell, it's a platform for bootstrapping protocol-owned liquidity! (Think Balancer LBPs for POL)

Any questions, please give myself, @jumbo and @Louis_Myself a shout!

Hi, any estimated time for the judging to complete for this contest? I saw that the sponsor review has been completed for quite a while. Thanks!

Sponsor review was actually just completed last weekend so the judge started work this week - I expect we'll have it back early next week. 🙂
