Do you guys succeed in running `yarn` on the repo?
I'm getting this
```
warning package.json: "dependencies" has dependency "hardhat" with range "^2.7.0" that collides with a dependency in "devDependencies" of the same name with version "^2.1.1"

Ya, I got that too. In the root directory, in `package.json` under `"scripts"`, remove the script for `prepare` and try again.


[15-Dec-21 06:36 PM] broccolirob#8828
Also, `cd packages/contracts` from root before running `npx hardhat test`


[15-Dec-21 06:36 PM] Kenzo Agada | AFK for a while#5926
Are the tests running successfully afterwards?


[15-Dec-21 06:36 PM] Kenzo Agada | AFK for a while#5926
I mean, relatively successfully. 🙂


[15-Dec-21 06:37 PM] broccolirob#8828
Ya, `cd packages/contracts` and then `npx hardhat test` they're passing, but they haven't finished yet for me


[15-Dec-21 06:37 PM] Kenzo Agada | AFK for a while#5926
Thanks 👍

Hey wardens, apologies for the confusion, the problem arose while uploading the files to the C4 repo. The package.json file has been modified and `yarn` just has to be run in the `./packages/contracts` directory. Then you can run `npx hardhat test` to run the tests. Running a specific test is done like `npx hardhat test ./test/AccessControlTest.js`. I would recommend running an individual test first to make sure it works before running the entire suite. If you get an error like `ECONNRESET` then just run the test again. Thanks!

Hi, can I ask that in recovery mode, ICR <= 100% and the system does redistribution, it means that all troves will receive more debt than collateral right?

That is correct. This is just so the system still has defined behavior in this case, though it is very unlikely to happen
