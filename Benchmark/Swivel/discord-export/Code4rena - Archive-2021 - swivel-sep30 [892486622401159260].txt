[29-Sep-21 05:54 PM] Julian | Swivel#6740
gost is our custom testing framework written in go / directly interacting with geth


[29-Sep-21 05:55 PM] Julian | Swivel#6740
We decided to link to it instead of a general project repo so folks could check out the tests if they wanted

Hey guys, two folks asked for more info on exactly the interaction between the methods  `exit` or `initiate`, and the `exit` and `vault` params in the orders these methods might fill. (its the most needlessly confusing part of our protocol lol)


[01-Oct-21 07:04 AM] Julian | Swivel#6740
That said, @itsmeSTYJ was kind enough to put together a quick sheet that organizes / explicitly explains each 🙂

Bit confused, why code is calculating interest everytime any user adds ntokens on same vault and not when user exits the ntoken position via redeem? (considering exchange rate can be fluctuating)


[01-Oct-21 10:30 AM] Julian | Swivel#6740
The interest should be recalculated during the redeem

[01-Oct-21 10:31 AM] Julian | Swivel#6740
If redeemed pre-maturity, it calculates since the last interaction exchangeRate -> current exchangeRate


[01-Oct-21 10:31 AM] Julian | Swivel#6740
if redeemed post-maturity, it calculates the last interaction exchangeRate -> the rate when the market matured

got it thanks
