Reggie provides Vera a public key\n * @dev to which he knows the secret key. Each time Vera provides a seed to\n * @dev Reggie, he gives back a value which is computed completely\n * @dev deterministically from the seed and the secret key.\n *\n * @dev Reggie provides a proof by which Vera can verify that the output was\n * @dev correctly computed once Reggie tells it to her, but without that proof,\n * @dev the output is indistinguishable to her from a uniform random sample\n * @dev from the output space.\n *\n * @dev The purpose of this contract is to make it easy for unrelated contracts\n * @dev to talk to Vera the verifier about the work Reggie is doing, to provide\n * @dev simple access to a verifiable source of randomness.\n * *****************************************************************************\n * @dev USAGE\n *\n * @dev Calling contracts must inherit from VRFConsumerInterface, and can\n * @dev initialize VRFConsumerInterface's attributes in their constructor as\n * @dev shown:\n *\n * @dev   contract VRFConsumer {\n * @dev     constuctor(<other arguments>, address _vrfCoordinator, address _link)\n * @dev       VRFConsumerBase(_vrfCoordinator, _link) public {\n * @dev         <initialization with other arguments goes here>\n * @dev       }\n * @dev   }\n *\n * @dev The oracle will have given you an ID for the VRF keypair they have\n * @dev committed to (let's call it keyHash), and have told you the minimum LINK\n * @dev price for VRF service. Make sure your contract has sufficient LINK, and\n * @dev call requestRandomness(keyHash, fee, seed), where seed is the input you\n * @dev want to generate randomness from.\n *\n * @dev Once the VRFCoordinator has received and validated the oracle's response\n * @dev to your request, it will call your contract's fulfillRandomness method.\n *\n * @dev The randomness argument to fulfillRandomness is the actual random value\n * @dev generated from your seed.\n *\n * @dev The requestId argument is generated from the keyHash and the seed by\n * @dev makeRequestId(keyHash, seed). If your contract could have concurrent\n * @dev requests open, you can use the requestId to track which seed is\n * @dev associated with which randomness. See VRFRequestIDBase.sol for more\n * @dev details.\n *\n * @dev Colliding `requestId`s are cryptographically impossible as long as seeds\n * @dev differ. (Which is critical to making unpredictable randomness! See the\n * @dev next section.)\n *\n * *****************************************************************************\n * @dev SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS\n *\n * @dev Since the ultimate input to the VRF is mixed with the block hash of the\n * @dev block in which the request is made, user-provided seeds have no impact\n * @dev on its economic security properties. They are only included for API\n * @dev compatability with previous versions of this contract.\n *\n * @dev Since the block hash of the block which contains the requestRandomness()\n * @dev call is mixed into the input to the VRF *last*, a sufficiently powerful\n * @dev miner could, in principle, fork the blockchain to evict the block\n * @dev containing the request, forcing the request to be included in a\n * @dev different block with a different hash, and therefore a different input\n * @dev to the VRF.
