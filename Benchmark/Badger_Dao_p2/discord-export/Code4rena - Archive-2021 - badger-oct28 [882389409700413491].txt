Does `main award pot` always mean that there are rewards only for discovering bugs and not for gas optimization?


[03-Sep-21 03:56 PM] ninek | C4#1475
hey there, sorry bout the confusion there! there's a default 5% gas pool on every contest unless otherwise specified, but we didn't communicate that clearly in this contest repo, so that's our bad 🙏 thanks for the catch!

Was asked about the original code for ibBTC:
https://etherscan.io/address/0xc4e15973e6ff2a35cc804c2cf9d2a1b817a8b40f

Also our goal with this contest is to enable this Curve pool:
https://curve.fi/factory/60

Feel free to reach for more questions


[28-Oct-21 05:50 AM] Laezo#5406
the repo doesn't contain any tests?


[28-Oct-21 05:50 AM] Laezo#5406
has the code been tested?


[28-Oct-21 06:06 AM] dapp-whisperer#0001
Hi Koustre, the tests are partially developed but still in the works


[28-Oct-21 06:06 AM] dapp-whisperer#0001
The code is running live in the curve pool linked above


[28-Oct-21 06:07 AM] dapp-whisperer#0001
(The code retains upgradability until finalized)

@🐺wardens This post is a little late, but the BadgerDAO contest is closed! Huge thanks to everyone who participated 🔍, whether you submitted a finding or not. 🎉 

What's next: the Badger team will review the findings over the next couple of days, and then we'll pass them off to the judge. We'll announce awards 🤑🏆 in 🐺 #🐺wardens, and keep an eye on #📢announcements for regular updates on how the contest is progressing through judging 🧑‍⚖️ and reporting 📜. Feel free to ping an organizer if you have questions along the way!

If `governance` is a timelock contract, then it's cool already. Otherwise, consider creating two functions, one to set a pending `oracle` with a timelock, another one to finalize the change.
