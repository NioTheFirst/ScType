For those using hardhat, there is now a `hardhat` branch which fixes all the compilation errors related to the use of hardhat. The main branch is using brownie so it never produced any of the errors there.

It doesn’t just compile because there’s no config file. I had to run

```
brownie pm install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts@3.4.1-solc-0.7-2
brownie pm install uniswap/uniswap-v3-core@1.0.0  

```
And still, I had to change the imports to “OpenZeppelin” instead of lowercase for it to work.
