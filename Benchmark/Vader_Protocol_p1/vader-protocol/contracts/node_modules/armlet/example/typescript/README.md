Here we have some minimal typescript code that can be run to show
how to use armlet. See the parent folder for code that uses nodejs or javascript.


Input parameter handling is minimal and command options are lacking so
we can focus on how to set up and call the client.

Before running you need to install some nodejs modules. Do that with:

```
$ npm install "@types/node"
```
